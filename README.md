The Student Registration and Management System is a dynamic web application designed for college festivals. It allows students to register for a debate event and provides administrators with the ability to manage student records efficiently. The system employs the Spring framework, Hibernate ORM, and Spring Security to create a secure and user-friendly environment.

Key Features:

Insert New Records: Students can register for the debate event by entering their first name, last name, course, and country. This information is stored in the database for future reference.

Update Existing Records: Registered students can edit their details, such as their name, course, or country, if needed.

Delete Existing Records: Registered students or administrators can delete records from the database when necessary.

View All Records: Both students and administrators can view a list of all registered students, making it easy to manage and keep track of participants.

Role-Based Security: The system has two roles - USER and ADMIN.

ADMIN: Administrators have the privilege to perform all operations, including insert, update, delete, and view student records.
USER: Regular users can only view and register for the event but cannot modify or delete records.
